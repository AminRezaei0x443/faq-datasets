                "a": "Generally, anyone with healthy gums and teeth that are looking to brighten up their smile can benefit from the professional teeth whitening system. It has been shown to be highly effective at removing stains from teeth, including tobacco, coffee, tea, tetracycline, and various other tooth stains. A professional teeth whitening system will not affect existing dental work.",

                "a": "The process was designed to enhance the natural whiteness of the enamel. Existing restorations such as tooth-colored fillings, dentures, crowns, bonding, veneers, and bridges do not lighten. This means that any pre-existing dental work may need to be replaced to match the new tooth shade achieved in the natural teeth, should a bleaching process proceed. Clients typically apply the gel product only to their natural teeth, allowing these treated teeth to lighten up to match a cap, crown, or veneer.",

Those who avoid foods and beverages that stain may be able to wait one year or longer before another whitening treatment or touch-up is needed.",

It is broken down into two 15-minute applications to allow for maximum gel concentration and light exposure, without being under the light for too long of a period to cause gum irritation.

First, avoid eating or drinking any items that can stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, soda, berries, and anything tomato-based. If you do choose to eat and drink these items, be sure to rinse your mouth or brush your teeth afterward.

Unlike over-the-counter kits, professional whitening uses a stronger formula that can provide you with a noticeably whiter smile in a single treatment. At-home kits that you can pick up at the drugstore often take a week or longer to provide noticeable results.",

In-office whitening treatments also yield very bright results after one application. It may take weeks of using a potentially damaging store-bought kit to achieve the desired results. Some dental offices, like Allred Family Dentistry, offer professional at-home kits that are just as effective as in-office services but with the convenience of whitening at home. These types of kits are a fantastic solution for busy patients who might not have the time in their schedule for in-office whitening appointments.",

                "a": "Once your desired brightness level is achieved, you likely won’t need to touch-up your smile for at least a year or even longer. This really comes down to your oral care and lifestyle habits. For example, if you smoke or drink a lot of coffee or wine, you may only want to wait six months or so before touching up. During your normal six-month checkups and cleaning with your dentist, feel free to ask them how your teeth are looking.  They can tell you if it’s time for another whitening session.",

At-home whitening isn’t inherently bad, but they do have some cons to them. For one, it’s easy to overuse an at-home whitening product. This may damage your teeth, either through enamel damage or painful sensitivity.

As the name suggests, stain-lifting is the act of lifting stains off the teeth. This occurs during whitening as well as bleaching. Whitening is the process of removing discoloration and getting teeth back to their natural white color. Bleaching is a more in-depth whitening process that gets teeth beyond a natural white color.

If you do still experience some sensitivity after whitening, try to avoid hot and cold food items as well as very sweet or acidic/sour foods. You can also switch to an . Tooth sensitivity from whitening is generally temporary. If you’re experiencing lasting sensitivity or pain, stop whitening and contact your dentist.

In fact, charcoal whitening toothpaste can even . This occurs when the abrasive nature of the gritty charcoal wears away enamel, allowing the product to darken the inner dentin layer. The initial stain removal you may see with these products is misleading as it isn’t so much that your teeth are getting whiter, but rather your enamel is being stripped away past the stained layer.

Younger teens around age 14 or so are often the best candidates for this treatment, since their teeth are able to absorb oxygen more effectively.",

In general, in-office whitening may be a better choice if you are looking for the fastest and most dramatic results possible. If you already have some dental sensitivity, you are likely to be a better candidate for office care. At-home treatment may be the optimal choice if you are on a budget or you want to whiten your teeth in the convenience of your own home. Your dentist will provide a thorough consultation and help you choose the right treatment for your budget, lifestyle, and dental health.",

As soon as that first tooth appears, you can start using a toothbrush. Be sure to use one with soft bristles and a small head. You can find a toothbrush designed for infants at your local drugstore. Once your child’s teeth erupt (appear), examine them every two weeks, checking for lines and discoloration that can indicate tooth decay. Sugary foods and liquids can easily attack a new tooth, so be sure to brush your child’s teeth after feeding or eating.  We suggest brushing four times a day: after breakfast, after lunch, after dinner and at bedtime. Do you have questions? We know that’s a lot of information, and we’ll be happy to discuss the best way to clean your child’s death and establish healthy habits that will last a lifetime.",

                "a": "First, the pediatric dentist aims to provide a “good dental home” for the child.  If a dental emergency does arise, parents can take the child for treatment at a familiar, comfortable location. Second, the pediatric dentist keeps meticulous records of the child’s ongoing dental health and jaw development.  In general, painful dental conditions do not arise overnight.  If the pediatric dentist understands the child’s dental health history, it becomes easier to anticipate future issues and intervene before they arise. Third, the pediatric dentist is able to educate parents and children during the visit.  Sometimes the pediatric dentist wants to introduce one or several factors to enhance tooth health - for example, sealants, fluoride supplements, or xylitol.  Other times, the pediatric dentist asks parents to change the child’s dietary or oral behavior - for example, reducing sugar in the child’s diet, removing an intraoral piercing, or even transitioning the child from sippy cups to adult-sized drinking glasses. Finally, dental X-rays are often the only way to identify tiny cavities in primary (baby) teeth.  Though the child may not be feeling any pain, left unchecked, these tiny cavities can rapidly turn into large cavities, tooth decay, and eventually, childhood periodontal disease.  Dental X-rays are only used when the pediatric dentist suspects cavities or orthodontic irregularities.",

                "a": "The condition of a child’s teeth can change fairly rapidly.  Even if the child’s teeth were evaluated as healthy just six months prior, changes in diet or oral habits (for example, thumb sucking) can quickly render them vulnerable to decay or misalignment. In addition to visual examinations, the pediatric dentist provides thorough dental cleanings during each visit.  These cleanings eradicate the plaque and debris that can build up between teeth and in other hard to reach places.  Though a good homecare routine is especially important, these professional cleanings provide an additional tool to keep smiles healthy. The pediatric dentist is also able to monitor the child’s fluoride levels during routine visits.  Oftentimes, a topical fluoride gel or varnish is applied to teeth after the cleaning.  Topical fluoride remineralizes the teeth and staunches mineral loss, protecting tooth enamel from oral acid attacks.  Some children are also given take-home fluoride supplements (especially those residing in areas where fluoride is not routinely added to the community water supply). Finally, the pediatric dentist may apply dental sealants to the child’s back teeth (molars).  This impenetrable liquid plastic substance is brushed onto the molars to seal out harmful debris, bacteria, and acid. If you have questions or concerns about when to schedule your child’s dental checkups please contact your pediatric dentist.",

                "a": "Initially, the pediatric dentist will perform visual examinations and evaluate X-rays of the affected areas.  The amount and location of pulp damage dictates the nature of the treatment.  Although there are several other treatments available, the pediatric pulpotomy and pulpectomy procedures are among the most common performed. - If the pulp root remains unaffected by injury or decay, meaning that the problem is isolated in the pulp tip, the pediatric dentist may leave the healthy part alone and only remove the affected pulp and surrounding tooth decay.  The resulting gap is then filled with a biocompatible, therapeutic material, which prevents infection and soothes the pulp root. Most commonly, a crown is placed on the tooth after treatment.  The crown strengthens the tooth structure, minimizing the risk of future fractures. Pulpotomy treatment is extremely versatile.  It can be performed as a standalone treatment on baby teeth and growing permanent teeth, or as the initial step in a full root canal treatment. - In the case of severe tooth decay or trauma, the entire tooth pulp (including the root canals) may be affected.  In these circumstances, the pediatric dentist must remove the pulp, cleanse the root canals, and then pack the area with biocompatible material.  This usually takes several office visits. In general, reabsorbable material is used to fill primary teeth, and non-reabsorbable material is used to fill permanent teeth.  Either way, the final treatment step is to place a crown on the tooth to add strength and provide structural support.  The crown can be disguised with a natural-colored covering, if the child prefers. If you have questions or concerns about the pediatric pulp therapy procedure, please contact your pediatric dentist.",

The major differences between brands are the thickness of the paste, the level of fluoride content, and the type of flavoring.  Although fluoride strengthens enamel and repels plaque bacteria, too much of it can actually harm young teeth – a condition known as dental fluorosis.  Children between the ages of one and four years old are most at risk for this condition, so fluoride levels should be carefully monitored during this time. Be aware that adult and non-ADA approved brands of toothpaste often contain harsher abrasives, which remove tooth enamel and weaken primary teeth.  In addition, some popular toothpaste brands contain sodium lauryl sulfate (shown as “SLS” on the package), which cause painful mouth ulcers in some children.",

                "q": "So which toothpaste brand should I choose?",
                "a": "The most important considerations to make before implementing an oral care plan and choosing a toothpaste brand is the age of the child.  Home oral care should begin before the emergence of the first tooth.  A cool clean cloth should be gently rubbed along the gums after feeding to remove food particles and bacteria. Prior to the age of two, the child will have many teeth and brushing should begin.  Initially, select fluoride-free “baby” toothpaste and softly brush the teeth twice per day.  Flavoring is largely unimportant, so the child can play an integral role in choosing whatever type of toothpaste tastes most pleasant. Between the middle and the end of the third year, select an American Dental Association (ADA) accepted brand of toothpaste containing fluoride.  The ADA logo is clear and present on toothpaste packaging, so be sure to check for it.  Use only a tiny pea or rice-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste, and encourage the child to spit out the excess after brushing.  Eliminating the toothpaste takes practice, patience, and motivation – especially if the child finds the flavoring tasty.  If the child does ingest tiny amounts of toothpaste, don’t worry; this is perfectly normal and will cease with time and encouragement. Dental fluorosis is not a risk factor for children over the age of eight, but an ADA accepted toothpaste is always the recommended choice for children of any age. If you have questions or concerns about choosing an appropriate brand of toothpaste for your child, your pediatric dentist will be happy to make recommendations.",

In particular, infants who drink breast milk, juice, baby formula, soda, or sweetened water from a baby bottle or sippy cup are at high-risk for early childhood caries (cavities).  To counteract this threat, the pediatric dentist discourages parents from filling cups with sugary fluids, dipping pacifiers in honey, and transmitting oral bacteria to the child via shared spoons and/or cleaning pacifiers in their own mouths. Importantly, the pediatric dentist can also assess and balance the infant’s fluoride intake.  Too much fluoride ingestion between the ages of one and four years old may lead to a condition known as fluorosis in later childhood.  Conversely, too little fluoride may render young tooth enamel susceptible to tooth decay.",

                "a": "In general, teeth emerge in pairs, starting at the front of the infant’s mouth.  Between the ages of six and ten months, the two lower central incisors break through.  Remember that cavities may develop between two adjacent teeth, so flossing should begin at this point. Next (and sometimes simultaneously), the two upper central incisors emerge – usually between the ages of eight and twelve months.  Teething can be quite an uncomfortable process for the infant.  Clean teething rings and cold damp cloths can help ease the irritation and discomfort. Between the ages of nine and sixteen months the upper lateral incisors emerge – one on either side of the central incisors.  Around the same time, the lower lateral incisors emerge, meaning that the infant has four adjacent teeth on the lower and upper arches.  Pediatric dentists suggest that sippy cup usage should end when the toddler reaches the age of fourteen months. This minimizes the risk of “baby bottle tooth decay.” Eight more teeth break through between the ages of thirteen and twenty three months.  On each arch, a cuspid or canine tooth will appear immediately adjacent to each lateral incisor.  Immediately behind (looking towards the back of the child’s mouth), first molars will emerge on either side of the canine teeth on both jaws. Finally, a second set of molars emerges on each arch – usually beginning on the lower arch.  Most children have a complete set of twenty primary teeth before the age of thirty-three months.  The pediatric dentist generally applies dental sealant to the molars, to lock out food particles, bacteria, and enamel-attacking acids.",

                "q": "What are the functions of primary teeth?",
                "a": "Primary teeth can be painful to acquire.  To soothe tender gums, biting on chewing rings, wet gauze pads, and clean fingers can be helpful.  Though most three-year-old children have a complete set of primary teeth, eruption happens gradually – usually starting at the front of the mouth. The major functions of primary teeth are described below: – Learning to speak clearly is crucial for cognitive, social, and emotional development.  The proper positioning of primary teeth facilitates correct syllable pronunciation and prevents the tongue from straying during speech formation. – Children with malformed or severely decayed primary teeth are more likely to experience dietary deficiencies, malnourishment, and to be underweight.  Proper chewing motions are acquired over time and with extensive practice.  Healthy primary teeth promote good chewing habits and facilitate nutritious eating. – Even very young children can be quick to point out ugly teeth and crooked smiles.  Taking good care of primary teeth can make social interactions more pleasant, reduce the risk of bad breath, and promote confident smiles and positive social interactions. – One of the major functions of primary teeth is to hold an appropriate amount of space for developing adult teeth.  In addition, these spacers facilitate the proper alignment of adult teeth and also promote jaw development.  Left untreated, missing primary teeth cause the remaining teeth to “shift” and fill spaces improperly.  For this reason, pediatric dentists often recommend space-maintaining devices. – Badly decayed primary teeth can promote the onset of childhood periodontal disease.  As a result of this condition, oral bacteria invade and erode gums, ligaments, and eventually bone.  If left untreated, primary teeth can drop out completely – causing health and spacing problems for emerging permanent teeth.  To avoid periodontal disease, children should practice an adult-guided oral care routine each day, and infant gums should be rubbed gently with a clean, damp cloth after meals. If you have questions or concerns about primary teeth, please contact your pediatric dentist.",

Early visits also help establish a positive relationship between the dentist and your child.",

                "a": "Radiographs (x-rays) are a necessary part of your child's dental diagnostic process.  We can only see so much with the naked eye and without radiographs, there may be hidden cavities between the teeth that may go undetected. Radiographs also help survey developing teeth, evaluate results an injury, or plan for orthodontic treatment.  If dental problems are found and treated early, dental care is more comfortable for your child, and more affordable for you. Our office will request bitewing radiographs twice a year in children with a high risk for tooth decay. Panoramic radiographs are taken every 3-5 years to help evaluate the growing adult teeth. With contemporary safeguards, the amount of radiation received in a dental x-ray examination is extremely small.  The risk is negligible.  In fact, the dental radiographs represent a far smaller risk than an undetected and untreated dental problem.  Lead body aprons and shields will protect your child. Today's equipment restricts the beam to the area of interest.  Our office also employs digital radiography which allows us to decrease the amount of radiation exposure.",

                "a": "A sealant is a clear or shaded plastic material that is applied to the chewing surfaces (grooves) for the back teeth (premolars and molars), where most cavities in children can form.  This sealant acts as a barrier to food, plaque, and acid, thus protecting the decay-prone areas of the teeth.  However, cavities between the teeth are not protected by sealants.  As long as there is no cavity in the tooth, sealants are recommended for all children as a preventative measure. If your child has a cavity, the decay is removed and a filling is placed.  A white composite filling is recommended to restore the tooth. Only in certain situations is a silver amalgam filling indicated.  In our practice, when a tooth needs a white composite filling, a sealant is placed over the filling and the remaining tooth surface for added protection. In a primary tooth, if a cavity is too large to restore with a filling, a crown may be recommend or the tooth may need to come out.  If the cavity touches the nerve but an abscess/infection has not formed yet, it may be possible to save the tooth by performing a nerve treatment called a pulpotomy and enclosing the whole tooth in a stainless steel crown.",

Because cavities form when bacteria on the teeth erode at the tooth enamel, foods that are likely to cause cavities, like acidic foods, and sugary foods can create the perfect environment for cavities, especially if oral hygiene is not diligent. Encouraging a healthy oral environment where plaque is banished daily may help to prevent cavities before they start. Eating healthy food, brushing teeth several times a day, flossing, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding foods that may increase unhealthy bacteria in your mouth will all do their part in helping you create a mouth that is hostile to cavities.",

                "a": "Having a regular cleaning of your teeth can help prevent cavities and give you strategies to maintain good oral hygiene between visits. It also gives you an opportunity to discuss concerns or issues with your dentist, and gives your dentist an opportunity to address them regularly. Preventative care often catches problems early, so you can address them when they are small. Over time it may even save you money, allowing you to address dental needs before they become expensive and time consuming.",

Using a soft bristled toothbrush can assist in gentle removal of plaque, your dentist can also recommend products that will assist in caring for sensitive teeth. Highly acidic foods can also wear away at tooth enamel, causing sensitivity to increase. Avoiding these foods can help. Using a fluoridated mouthwash and toothpaste can also help sensitive teeth. One cause of sensitive teeth can be teeth grinding. Talk to your dentist about whether using a mouth guard may help decrease sensitivity for you.",

Because cavities form when bacteria on the teeth erode at the tooth enamel, foods that are likely to cause cavities, like acidic foods, and sugary foods can create the perfect environment for cavities, especially if oral hygiene is not diligent. Encouraging a healthy oral environment where plaque is banished daily may help to prevent cavities before they start. Eating healthy food, brushing teeth several times a day, flossing, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding foods that may increase unhealthy bacteria in your mouth will all do their part in helping you create a mouth that is hostile to cavities.",

Brushing and flossing mechanically removes food and bacteria from the tooth surfaces, and is the best way to prevent cavities and gum disease. Brushing, however, cannot physically get in between your teeth. When bacteria and food are allowed to sit next to your teeth for a long period of time, the plaque will begin to harden from the minerals naturally present in your saliva, and a tough deposit will start to form that only a dental hygienist can remove. The process is basically the same as soap scum forming in your bathroom. Gross, huh? By flossing daily, you can eliminate the bacteria before it has a chance to harden, which will keep your teeth and gums healthy and happy.",

                "a": "In order to understand why fluoride is so great, it’s important to understand how cavities form. They don’t just appear overnight, but are the end result of a process called caries. What happens is this; you eat carbohydrates, the bacteria naturally present in your mouth eats the carbohydrates, and then the secret acid. It is the acid itself that starts to slowly dissolve your tooth structure. At first, the tooth will just appear to be demineralized. Over time, the tooth structure will weaken. The point where it’s formed a hole, or cavity, is when a dentist needs to intervene and place a filling. However, fluoride can help prevent, and even reverse, this process! Fluoride ions actually can swap places with the calcium ions in your teeth. Fluoride bonded to tooth structure is actually less soluble in acid than calcium is. Therefore, it takes more bacteria and more time and more sugar to create a cavity. Voila!",

First of all, it will get your child used to coming to the dentist, so it doesn’t seem such a scary and intimidating place. Second of all, if there is something going on with the child’s teeth or oral cavity, it’s best to catch it as early as possible. Also, we can start applying fluoride, even if the child only has one tooth so far, it will help make it nice and strong! Finally, you can discuss with your dentist any questions you have about your child’s teeth and mouth, including teething, thumb sucking habits, pacifiers, et cetera.

That’s why they take x-rays, probe your gums, and perform a thorough evaluation every time you come in for a routine cleaning. If your dentist recommends treatment, it may be tempting to put it off if the tooth isn’t bothering you. We get it, few people actually enjoy being at the dentist. That said, the earlier you fix an existing issue, the more conservative treatment can be. Cavities only grow with time, and what started out as a simple filling can progress to root canal treatments and extractions. Even worse, teeth with large cavities can cause infections in your lips, cheeks, and throat, which may require antibiotics, hospitalization, or even death.",

This is great news for the thrifty and dedicated! That said, we’re all human. Few patients brush with perfect form and for the full 120 seconds every single time they brush their teeth. An electric toothbrush can help bridge the gap in technique, and most of them have built in timers to ensure you’re spending the proper time you need on each area of your mouth! We’ve seen countless patients come in with improved oral hygiene from one visit to the next, and it’s all due to purchasing an electric toothbrush. We also strongly recommend electric toothbrushes to patients with limited dexterity. As for which brand to choose, we’re big fans of Sonicare, but they all do a great job. Generally speaking, the added benefits come from the motion of the toothbrush and a timer, so spending a lot of extra dough for the fanciest edition out there won’t made that much of a difference.",

Its use has been instrumental in the dramatic drop in tooth decay and cavity occurrence that has taken place over the past 50 years. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches that remain on your teeth after eating. Fluoride helps protect your teeth from the acid that is released when this happens. It does this in two ways. First, fluoride makes your tooth enamel stronger and less likely to suffer acid damage. Second, it can reverse the early stages of acid damage by solidifying areas that have started to decay.",

Bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. Over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay.

Dental sealants are a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution for preventing cavities. They are thin coatings applied to the biting surfaces that help prevent bacteria and other debris from getting into the deep crevices on the teeth. Young children are great candidates for preventative measures like sealants because in many cases, decay has not set in. Children’s teeth tend to benefit more from sealants because these pits and groves tend to be deeper and less calcified then they are in adults. Kids are notoriously bad brushers and tend to ignore the problem areas in the back of the mouth that lead to cavities and decay.",

Its use has been instrumental in the dramatic drop in tooth decay and cavity occurrence that has taken place over the past 50 years. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches that remain on your teeth after eating. Fluoride helps protect your teeth from the acid that is released when this happens. It does this in two ways. First, fluoride makes your tooth enamel stronger and less likely to suffer acid damage. Second, it can reverse the early stages of acid damage by solidifying areas that have started to decay.",

Bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. Over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay.

Untreated cavities also increase the amount of decay causing bacteria in the mouth. As permanent teeth erupt, they are at increased risk for developing cavities because of the higher bacteria count. Baby teeth also hold space in the mouth for the erupting permanent teeth.

Dental sealants are a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution for preventing cavities. They are thin coatings applied to the biting surfaces that help prevent bacteria and other debris from getting into the deep crevices on the teeth. Young children are great candidates for preventative measures like sealants because in many cases, decay has not set in. Children’s teeth tend to benefit more from sealants because these pits and groves tend to be deeper and less calcified then they are in adults. Kids are notoriously bad brushers and tend to ignore the problem areas in the back of the mouth that lead to cavities and decay.",

                "a": "Tooth decay, also known as a cavity, occurs when bacteria living in your mouth make acid that begins to eat away at your teeth. Untreated tooth decay may cause infection, extreme pain and the loss of tooth. The decay process begins with the unnoticeable damage to the enamel of your teeth and then steadily progresses to deeper layers of the tooth, eventually leading to the pulp. The pulp of your teeth contains highly-sensitive blood vessels and nerves. Proper oral hygiene includes brushing your teeth regularly, flossing regularly and brushing your tongue. If possible brush your teeth twice a day – morning and night.

                "a": "The main cause of bleeding gums is the buildup of plaque at the gum line. This will lead to a condition called gingivitis, or inflamed gums. Plaque that is not removed will harden into tartar. This will lead to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and bone disease known as periodontitis. Bleeding gums can happen for a number of reasons, from gingivitis to a side effect of pregnancy. Changing your oral care routine can also make your gums bleed. We recommend brushing and flossing regularly and getting your semiannual dental visit in to stop your gums from bleeding. Certain medicines also increase the likelihood that your gums will bleed. If changing your oral care habits, adjusting your medications, and maintaining a healthy diet doesn’t help your gums stop bleeding, your next step should be to make a dental appointment.",

Exposed areas of the tooth can cause pain and even affect or change your eating, drinking, and breathing habits. Taking a spoonful of ice cream, for example, can be a painful experience for people who have sensitive teeth. Tooth sensitivity is one of the most common complaints among dental patients. Some toothpastes contain abrasive ingredients that may be too harsh for people who have sensitive teeth. Tooth sensitivity can be reduced by using a desensitizing toothpaste; having your dentist apply sealants and other desensitizing and filling materials, including fluoride; and decreasing the intake of acid-containing foods.",

For some people sugar-free gum or sugar-free candies may cause diarrhea or cramps if consumed in large amounts. To relieve your dry mouth you can try limiting your caffeine intake because caffeine can make your mouth drier. Also don’t use mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they can be drying.

Its use has been instrumental in the dramatic drop in tooth decay and cavity occurrence that has taken place over the past 50 years. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches that remain on your teeth after eating. Fluoride helps protect your teeth from the acid that is released when this happens. It does this in two ways. First, fluoride makes your tooth enamel stronger and less likely to suffer acid damage. Second, it can reverse the early stages of acid damage by solidifying areas that have started to decay.",

Bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. Over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay.

But many people don’t brush for the recommended two to three minutes. Children are also good candidates for powered brushes as their brushing habits tend to be less than optimal.

Dental sealants are a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution for preventing cavities. They are thin coatings applied to the biting surfaces that help prevent bacteria and other debris from getting into the deep crevices on the teeth. Young children are great candidates for preventative measures like sealants because in many cases, decay has not set in. Children’s teeth tend to benefit more from sealants because these pits and groves tend to be deeper and less calcified then they are in adults.

Bleeding gums can happen for a number of reasons, from gingivitis to a side effect of pregnancy. Changing your oral care routine can also make your gums bleed. We recommend brushing and flossing regularly and getting your semiannual dental visit in to stop your gums from bleeding. Certain medicines also increase the likelihood that your gums will bleed.

                "a": "The American Dental Association recommends that kids receive dental sealants as soon as their adult teeth erupt. Dental sealants are a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution for preventing cavities. They are thin coatings applied to the biting surfaces that help prevent bacteria and other debris from getting into the deep crevices on the teeth. Young children are great candidates for preventative measures like sealants because in many cases, decay has not set in. Children’s teeth tend to benefit more from sealants because these pits and groves tend to be deeper and less calcified then they are in adults. Kids are notoriously bad brushers and tend to ignore the problem areas in the back of the mouth that lead to cavities and decay.",

Bleeding gums can happen for a number of reasons, from gingivitis to a side effect of pregnancy. Changing your oral care routine can also make your gums bleed. We recommend brushing and flossing regularly and getting your semiannual dental visit in to stop your gums from bleeding. Certain medicines also increase the likelihood that your gums will bleed.

Dental sealants are a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution for preventing cavities. They are thin coatings applied to the biting surfaces that help prevent bacteria and other debris from getting into the deep crevices on the teeth. Young children are great candidates for preventative measures like sealants because in many cases, decay has not set in. Children’s teeth tend to benefit more from sealants because these pits and groves tend to be deeper and less calcified then they are in adults. Kids are notoriously bad brushers and tend to ignore the problem areas in the back of the mouth that lead to cavities and decay.",

It also means that regular cleanings are even more important for people who may be have less-than-deal ideal oral hygiene practices. If you experience tartar build-up at a faster rate than the average person, it’s possible that the frequency of your cleanings may need to be increased. Don’t forget that if you have , most plans cover two cleanings per year.

Note, however, that proper use of a manual toothbrush, especially brushing long enough, often doesn’t happen. Children, in particular, may benefit from an electric toothbrush because they are more likely to have poorer brushing habits.

                "a": "First, it means that the bone will begin to gradually change. More specifically, it will begin to shrink. Over time, that means the dentures you once had fitted for your mouth, say, five years ago, no longer fit well. Note that trying to compensate for looser dentures by using excess denture adhesive is not a good remedy. In fact, doing this can actually lead to more rapid bone loss—and a worsening denture fit.

Fluoride is absorbed easily into the tooth enamel, especially in children’s growing teeth. Once teeth are developed, fluoride makes the entire tooth structure more resistant to decay and promotes remineralization, which aids in repairing early decay before the damage is visible. Radiographs, or x-rays, help your dentist determine the presence or degree of periodontal disease, abscesses, and many abnormal growths such as cysts and tumors. They can help pinpoint the location of cavities and other signs of disease that may not be possible to detect through a visual examination. All health care providers are sensitive to patients’ concerns about exposure to radiation. Your dentist has been trained to prescribe radiographs when they are appropriate and to tailor the radiograph schedule to your individual needs. By using state-of-the-art technology, such as digital radiography, and by staying knowledgeable about recent advances, your dentist knows which techniques, procedures and X-ray films can minimize your exposure to radiation.",

The canal is filled with gutta percha, a rubberlike material, to prevent recontamination of the tooth. The tooth is then permanently sealed with possibly a post and/or a gold or porcelain crown.

It is also very important to maintain the baby teeth because these teeth hold space for the future eruption of the permanent teeth. If a baby tooth decays or is removed too early, the space necessary for the permanent teeth is lost and can only be regained through orthodontic treatment.

Don’t worry about getting it in straight or having it turned backwards, just get it in the socket and immediately call your dentist. If you are uncomfortable placing the tooth in the socket, put it in a glass of milk and get your child to the dentist as quickly as possible. If the tooth is a baby tooth, do not put it in the socket because damage to the permanent tooth can occur. When in doubt, put the tooth in milk and see your dentist immediately.",

Most people need to visit their dentist for a regular hygiene visit twice a year, or once every six months. There are exceptions to this rule, however. If you have gum disease, or a history of gum disease, your dentist may recommend more frequent visits. Another reason you may need to see the dentist more frequently is if you are undergoing orthodontic treatment. The bottom line is that and you need to comply if it is recommended that you make those visits more frequent.",

A cavity is simply a small hole in the tooth that develops as a result of tooth decay. In other words, decay eats away at the tooth and results in a void space that disrupts the structure of the tooth. It’s important to get cavities repaired because they will continue to grow larger with time.",

With time dental restorations may break down or become loose, allowing decay to enter the area around the restoration and become problematic. Although you can’t expect your fillings, bridges, and crowns to last forever, you can do your part to make them last as long as possible. Maintain great oral hygiene and visit your dentist regularly to keep those restorations in great condition for as long as possible.",

The fastest and most effective way to whiten teeth is typically an in-office professional whitening procedure. However, depending how dramatic you need your results to be, you may not require this type of procedure.  Our best advice is to speak with your dentist or dental hygienist about .  The best results are always going to be a result of a professional treatment, but your dentist can help you determine which treatment is right for you.",

Once the implant integrates to your bone, a structure called an abutment is connected to the implant and then the artificial tooth/teeth are attached.

They possess lower risk potential and their recovery period is shorter. However, for you to put these types of implants, you must have a good and healthy jawbone for the post to fuse to. Unlike Endosteal implants, Subperiosteal implants are not fixed into the jawbone. Instead, they are placed on top of the bone, but their position on the gum remains unchanged. A metal frame is fixed below the gum with a post linked to it. The gum relies on the frame for support. Patients with inadequate jawbone only use subperiosteal implants for an implant, and the patient is unwilling to do bone grafting to add bone to the affected area. zygomatic implants are not so common since they involve a complicated procedure, and they are limited to patients with the inadequate jawbone for the Endosteal implant.

Since it is an outpatient procedure, it takes place in different appointments that are several months apart. Dental implant surgery entails the use of local anesthesia or IV sedation to numb the mouth. A cut is made in your gums to insert the tooth root implant into the jawbone in the gap left by the missing tooth. After attaching the implant, the doctor will close the gums over the implant to ensure it is completely covered. Since a single procedure is not enough, you will wait for few months before going back for the second phase. This gives adequate time for the bone to develop around the implant. After the titanium has combined well with the bone, an abutment will be placed over on the part that will hold the new tooth. After your gums have healed, the dentist will create a which will then be fixed to the abutment.",

                "a": "Just like any surgery, some risks can follow after a dental implant procedure. Some of these risks include: Before a dental implant procedure, patients are normally given antibiotics to reduce the potential risk of infections. Unfortunately, they are unlikely to help minimize the occurrences of infection. Infection is so common after dental implantation. Infection occurs at the affected area giving rise to an abscess, inflammation or radiolucency. Infection can also spread to the neighboring areas causing a systematic infection. The dental implant procedure can result in excessive bone loss, leading to the emergence of black triangles between the teeth, which can pose challenges. Losing bones in the area of a dental implant can compromise the replacement’s stability, which can result in more complications. In case you suffer an implant breakage, the screw must be eliminated and the entire implant replaced. Having an implant fracture is dangerous since it weakens the remaining bone reducing its ability to support a new implant. Dental implant surgery is also linked with other minor complications such as nerve injury, destruction of the implant tissue cells, Failure of wound healing, hyperplasia, and excessive bleeding.",

Well, various factors will determine the recovery period since the state and the shape of your mouth are not the same. First, the recovery period can be determined on what was involved during the dental implant surgery: the number of fixed implants. Some people receive a single implant, while others receive multiple implants. Secondly, the recovery period will be affected by the nature of your bone and your general health condition. People who went through bone grafting before dental implant take a longer period to recover. Consequently, people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes take longer since the condition affects blood circulation, which is crucial in healing. People who smoke tobacco products and those who fail to follow all the treatment plan instructions take longer to recover. However, the average recovery period for a dental implant procedure is six to nine months.",

During the procedure of implanting the titanium roots, the dentist will likely use a local anesthesia. This means only the jaw area will feel numb and you'll stay awake during the operation.

The average period of recovery often only takes between three and six months. This is the time needed to let the jaw fuse with the artificial implant, allowing it to replace the original tooth root. This amount of time also lets the sutured tissues recover and let the stitches come off on their own.

First off, don't poke your gums or new implant with your fingers. It will only cause the area to swell due to the movement. Don't brush the area either because your gums and surrounding teeth are still sensitive. This also means avoiding crunchy food for a few weeks. Lastly, make sure to avoid any extraneous physical activity and exercises until the area heals. Before you even start, you'll have to begin the process with a few preparation steps. This may involve visiting different kinds of dentists like a periodontist and a maxillofacial specialist to determine the health and strength of your teeth, jaws, and gums.

                "q": "What Happens During a Dental Exam?",
                "a": "Regular dental exams play an essential role in keeping your teeth and gums healthy, but millions of people in the U.S. never see a dentist from year to year. Routine dental visits can detect problems early when treatment is likely to be more effective, simpler, and less costly. They can also prevent many potential issues from developing in the first place. Another reason why dental exams are a good idea is that certain serious medical conditions can show symptoms in your mouth you may not be aware of. Dental issues may also be a symptom- and pain-free, especially during the early stages. Y our dentist will be able to spot problems like these. This is why dental exams are important even if you have no apparent symptoms. However, many people appear to have little idea of exactly what happens during a dental exam. Well, there’s a lot more to it than just taking a quick look at your teeth. If it’s your first appointment at a particular practice, the dentist will ask you about your medical history. If a dentist has examined you before, they will want to know whether there have been any changes in your overall health. An insight into any medical conditions, treatment, and medication is important for your dentist to ensure no complications during dental treatment. Your medical history will also be an important factor for your dentist as they proceed with your check-up. Dentists use a metal probe with an angled mirror to see behind and between your teeth and check for warning signs of cavities – softening of enamel and dentin. Enamel is the hard surface of a tooth that protects the underlying dentin, which, in turn, shields the pulp in the center of the tooth. A routine dental exam also checks for indications of problems with the gums, such as swelling, redness, or sores. Your dentist will also measure the periodontal pockets – the spaces between the top of the gum line and where the soft tissue secures a tooth in place. Periodontal pockets deeper than three millimeters may be a sign of (periodontitis). The dentist will feel your jawbones while you bite down, to make sure your bite is aligned and there’s no clicking from the joints. They will also look for signs of jaw clenching, such as worn grooves of the teeth. Initial stages of oral cancer may not be noticed by the individual, so your dentist will be on the lookout for signs of mouth or throat cancer. These warning signs include lesions, sores or ulcers, unexplained bleeding, and blocked salivary glands. The American Cancer Society estimates that 51,500 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed in 2018 with oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer (affecting the throat at the back of the mouth, behind the oral cavity). These cancers are twice as common in men. The survival rate for cancer is good when the condition is diagnosed early. Gum infection and bad breath (halitosis) can indicate diabetes. Diabetics are prone to gum problems because they’re less able to fight off bacteria, including those in the mouth. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which occurs because of insufficient insulin, can lead to a sweet, fruity odor on the breath. A further oral indication of diabetes is bone loss. X-rays allow your dentist to detect any problems not visible to the naked eye – below the surface of the teeth and gums. Thanks to modern technology, dental X-rays are safer than ever. Digital X-rays have largely replaced the old film versions in many dental offices. They give off 80 to 90 percent less radiation than traditional film X-ray equipment. X-rays are indispensable in spotting issues such as jaw and tooth root problems, and gum infections including gingivitis. Detection of these issues at an early stage is vital for effective treatment. A dental exam typically includes a thorough cleaning by a dental hygienist or dentist. They will remove any plaque and tartar deposits by scraping above and below the gum line and flossing your teeth. A survey in 2006 indicated that flossing by a professional was far more effective than flossing at home, decreasing the risk of tooth decay by 40 percent. The cleaning process ends with the use of a spinning polisher, with a mildly abrasive head, to give your teeth a shiny, smooth finish, and to get rid of any residues of plaque, tartar and food particles previously missed. Making your teeth smoother isn’t just for cosmetic purposes: it makes it more difficult for plaque to latch on to them between dental visits. Continuity of dental care is necessary to keep your teeth and gums strong and healthy, but, according to the MouthHealthy consumer platform of the American Dental Association (ADA), 100 million people in the U.S. fail to see a dentist each year. Regular dental exams not only help to safeguard the health of your mouth but can also reveal signs of problems in other areas of the body because many medical conditions can affect your mouth. How often you should have a dental exam can only be determined by your dentist. Some patients need to visit the dentist once or twice a year, while others – those diagnosed with diabetes, for instance – will need more visits. A regular dental exam also gives your dentist the opportunity to remind you about the best ways to practice oral healthcare at home and to assess whether you could benefit from fluoride applications. Even if you no longer have your natural teeth, regular dental visits are important to maintain your oral health and the effectiveness of replacement teeth. Besides regular dental check-ups, the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) recommends that all adults should have a comprehensive periodontal evaluation (CPE) to identify any signs of gum disease and enable early intervention.",

A virus that is spread through contact and once you’ve contracted the virus it remains in your body. Cold sores are highly contagious when they break open and the fluid leaks from the open sore. As much as 50% of the world’s population have the herpes simplex virus, which makes this condition very common. Even if you do carry the virus, it doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop a cold sore. Right now, there is no cure for this virus. What you can do is treat the outbreaks to reduce their severity, prevent the sores from erupting and take care not to pass on and infect your family members or friends.",

This will often take about a week or more to resolve when untreated. Being a herpes virus, cold sores will appear as a cluster of raised blisters outside the mouth, on or around the lips. They can turn up under the nose and occasionally even under the chin. Always external to the mouth.",

Over the counter medications can help with the pain and your doctor can prescribe you an anti-viral medication to reduce healing time. Once you develop cold sores the best way to cope with them is prevention. Working out what triggers the emergence of a cold sore will help you manage them. If exposure to the sun brings them out then wearing sunscreen on the areas around your mouth where you usually get cold sores will help prevent an outbreak. If stress triggers cold sore outbreaks then finding ways of managing your anxiety levels can help avoid a cold sore appearing. Since this virus is highly contagious, when a cold sore appears you must avoid sharing drinking glasses and be careful not to touch the blister then touch other parts of your body. Kissing is best left until the blister clears up. If you have a dentist appointment when you have a cold sore, then rescheduling is best. Your mouth and the area around your lips will be more sensitive than usual, so you won’t want to be sitting in the dentist’s chair with your mouth open anyway.",

No studies in this review reported the effect of different check-up frequencies on detecting oral cancer. (Conway 2018). However, it has been reported that (Purkayastha 2018). It is estimated that dentists in Scotland will see a case of oral cancer once every 10-20 years – depending on the geographical location ( ). In addition, adults at higher risk of oral cancer are also at higher risk of dental decay and gum disease – people with higher alcohol intake, those who smoke, and individuals from lower socioeconomic status are at increased risk of all three diseases. A personalised risk-based check-up frequency would allow those individuals at greater risk to be seen more frequently, while healthy patients can be seen less frequently. Checking the health of the mouth is still recommended at every check-up, as is the recall of patients at high risk of dental disease and oral cancer more frequently than patients at low risk of these diseases. This research is also valuable when considering the significant impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its effect on dental services worldwide, limiting patient access to dental treatment. Patient access to dental care may remain limited for some time, however the results of this review provide reassurance that intervals between check-ups can be extended beyond six months without detriment to oral health.",
