Therefore, second-generation vaccines that are adapted to the new variants or that are able to protect against a wide range of coronaviruses ( ) will be needed, as well as vaccines that are administered to boost mucosal immunity and decrease transmission. It will also be important to have vaccines that are easier to produce locally, more affordable, and more stable at ambient temperatures to facilitate access and distribution in low-income countries. Some of these second-generation vaccines are already a reality. Pfizer and Moderna have adapted their mRNA vaccines to include the Omicron (BA.1 or BA.4/%) sequence in their formulation. China and India have to be used as booster and there are almost 100 other intranasal vaccines in development. With an adequate support, there are vaccines that could be produced easily and affordably in low and middle-income countries and that have shown to be safe and effective, such as a recombinant protein-based vaccine and a viral vector-based vaccine.",

Therefore, developing a universal vaccine that protects us not only against all SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also against other coronaviruses that could cause future outbreaks, has . Previous studies indicate that it is possible to develop a vaccine that targets, if not all coronaviruses, at least those belonging to the betacoronavirus family (such as SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS). It has been shown, for example, that serum from people who passed COVID-19 is able to neutralize (cross-neutralize) SARS or MERS. This is because all coronaviruses share certain genes (or gene segments) that are quite stable (i.e. do not change much over time). There is still a lot of work ahead to define which antigens to use in the vaccine and how to administer them, and many groups are actively working on this. The CEPI coalition has awarded almost that are exploring different ways of developing these broadly protective vaccines that could prevent a future coronavirus pandemic. For the moment, a vaccine and currently in advanced clinical phases has shown promise as a platform for a universal vaccine against beta-coronaviruses.",

This is the motto of the COVAX alliance, an initiative launched at the beginning of the pandemic by various public and private actors to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Its most basic commitment was to ensure that at least 20% of the population in all countries would be immunised by 2021. While it has fallen short of its targets, the partnership has managed to deliver a total of 900 million doses to low- and middle-income countries by 2021. Despite this, the reality is that the vaccines have not reached most of the world. For this reason, complementary initiatives have emerged, such as the African Vaccine Procurement Team for Africa, promoted by the African Union, which aims to vaccinate 60% of the continent's population by 2022 and has already managed to deliver 400 million doses. However, as long as richer countries continue to dominate the distribution of vaccines, it will be difficult for demand to ease. This tension only undermines the bargaining power of countries with fewer economic resources, which will continue to be at the mercy of bilateral donation agreements that do little to address the problem.",

                "a": "\"No one is safe unless everyone is safe\". This is the motto of the COVAX alliance, an initiative launched at the beginning of the pandemic by various public and private actors to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Its most basic commitment was to ensure that at least 20% of the population in all countries would be immunised by 2021. While it has fallen short of its targets, the partnership has managed to deliver a total of 900 million doses to low- and middle-income countries by 2021. Despite this, the reality is that the vaccines have not reached most of the world. For this reason, complementary initiatives have emerged, such as the African Vaccine Procurement Team for Africa, promoted by the African Union, which aims to vaccinate 60% of the continent's population by 2022 and has already managed to deliver 400 million doses. However, as long as richer countries continue to dominate the distribution of vaccines, it will be difficult for demand to ease. This tension only undermines the bargaining power of countries with fewer economic resources, which will continue to be at the mercy of bilateral donation agreements that do little to address the problem.",

Vaccination can prevent acute disease and, importantly, also the chronic consequences of the infection, such as the so-called Long Covid or the multi-inflammatory systemic syndrome (MIS-C), a rare but potentially serious complication that affects this age group.

Moreover, vaccination primarily protects against the individual risk of disease, and for this reason alone it is justified. There are many examples of other paediatric diseases where the risk of serious illness is even lower than with COVID-19, and yet we continue to vaccinate children.",

                "a": "Yes. The definition of a “free clinic,” as established by the authorizing statute for the Free Clinics FTCA Program, requires that the entity not seek reimbursement for the health care that it provides. Section 233(o)(3) of title 42, United States Code, states in pertinent part: “the entity does not, in providing health services through the facility, accept reimbursement from any third-party payor (including reimbursement under any insurance policy or health plan, or under any Federal or State health benefits program).” In addition, 42 U.S.C. § 233(o)(2)(D) precludes a health care practitioner or free clinic from receiving “any compensation for [a health service] from the individual or from any third-party payor (including reimbursement under any insurance policy or health plan, or under any Federal or State health benefits program).” state the following: The COVID-19 Claims Reimbursement to Health Care Providers and Facilities for Testing and Treatment of the Uninsured Program provides reimbursements on a rolling basis directly to eligible providers for claims that are attributed to the testing and treatment of COVID-19 for uninsured individuals. Health care providers who have conducted COVID-19 testing of uninsured individuals or provided treatment to uninsured individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis for dates of service or admittance on or after February 4, 2020 may be eligible for claims reimbursement through the program as long as the service(s) provided meet the and requirements established as part of the program. Under the Free Clinics FTCA Program, an entity that accepts or receives reimbursement for the provision of health services from a third-party payor is not eligible to sponsor a provider deeming application, nor may the entity or the provider accept such compensation for the service provided. Accepting such reimbursement may therefore place at risk the availability of liability protections under this statute for the actions of the entity’s deemed providers. Free clinics should consult private counsel as needed for legal advice. For additional information, see .",

As with all in-scope services, health centers should maintain appropriate health records and, where applicable, billing records for immunizations they provide, consistent with applicable standards of practice. Health centers that partner with other organizations conducting community-based immunization programs should maintain their own records to the extent practicable, and if unable to do so, should make arrangements with those organizations, as necessary, to obtain timely documentation of all individual immunizations administered by health center providers. Delivering health services on behalf of a third-party entity is generally another line of business outside the scope of the Health Center Program project. Health centers are also reminded that the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act provides to administrators of COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, who are authorized to administer vaccines under the PREP Act declaration covering COVID-19 tests, drugs, and vaccines. Please note that whether an activity is within the Health Center Program grant-supported scope of project does not affect the applicability of PREP Act protections. For additional resources, health centers may wish to review . Health centers may contact the state and/or local immunization program manager in their jurisdiction for more information about COVID-19 vaccines.
